Completing a level with an LDM built into the rated version on the servers will always be acceptable for records on the list.

LDMs published by a levelâ€™s creator are also acceptable for records as long as they match the gameplay of the rated version.

Custom LDMs of several list demons are uploaded on the Geometry Dash account named "Pointercrate". Records on any level published on the Pointercrate account will always be eligible for the list. Note that Pointercrate LDMs may be updated, so make sure to play on the most recent version of the level!
