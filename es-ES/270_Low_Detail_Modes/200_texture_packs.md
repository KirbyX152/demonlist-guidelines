# Texture Packs and Shaders{id=texture-packs-and-shaders}

## Texture Packs{id=texture-packs}

Any texture packs that make the gameplay of the level easier by altering decoration are prohibited for records on the list.

Texture packs that visibly alter hitboxes (e.g. spikes, but **not** player icons) to make them perceptively easier to avoid are also disallowed.

In addition, players should not use texture packs that make the text within the in-game endscreen impossible to read.

## Shaders{id=shaders}

A _shader_ is generally defined as any external software that alters the visuals of the game (e.g. glow, motion blur). The use of any shader is **prohibited for records on the list.**
