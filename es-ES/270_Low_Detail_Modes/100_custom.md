# Custom LDMs{id=custom-ldms}

Players are _strongly advised_ to clear any custom LDMs with the team before using them, especially if an LDM for the level already exists. Strong level LDMs may be considered nerfs, which violates our guidelines for [gameplay changes](/guidelines/eligibility#gameplay).

**Using a custom LDM carries the risk of a rejected record**! Even if an LDM has been approved in the past, it is always recommended to ask the list team whether it is still acceptable. Players may refer to our [LDM spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FqcYP8IwYstIueKWnow9b_07tscVNZBYIZyv-2SrH4o/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of approved LDMs.

## Custom LDM Guidelines{id=custom-ldm-guidelines}

A custom LDM may not _delete or otherwise alter any object that obstructs the playerâ€™s vision_. All gameplay must be kept exactly the same as the original level.

No part of the LDM should look visually "empty" compared to the original level.

The length of the LDM should be the exact same as the original level.

## Player Altered Decoration{id=player-altered-decoration}

Altered decoration that affects difficulty in any way, adds an unnecessary amount of clutter, or contains hate speech will lead to a record rejection.
