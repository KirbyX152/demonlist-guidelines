# Adding a Record{id=additions}

Submitted records are automatically assigned an ID number based on when they were submitted. The oldest submitted records are generally checked first; however, records are occasionally added out of order, so seeing another record getting added before yours does not necessarily mean your record was rejected.

*Players can check the status of their record by re-submitting it on the submission form or by checking their profile in the [User Area](/login).*

## Under Consideration Records{id=uc}

[Under consideration](/guidelines/eligibility/#uc-records) indicates that the list team is not immediately sure whether the record is acceptable, but it **does not** necessarily mean there is suspicion of hacking.

In many cases, the list team will reach out for additional information regarding a record marked as under consideration. *A player has **three days** to respond to each request from a list team member before their record will be automatically rejected.* However, a player may still reach out to a team member after this deadline for their record to be reconsidered.

## Rejected Records{id=rejected}
  
If a submitted record does not satisfy the submission guidelines listed here, the record will be rejected.

A list team member will often include a **Public Note** regarding the reasons for rejection, which can be viewed in the [**User Area**](/login). If you believe your record was wrongfully rejected, or if you have additional evidence to share with us, feel free to reach out to a team member!
