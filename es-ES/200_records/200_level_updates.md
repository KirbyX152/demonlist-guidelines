# Level Updates{id=level-updates}

An update to a level that significantly increases its difficulty will cause all existing records for the level to be removed. Records will be maintained if the level maintains a similar difficulty or is nerfed.

Any update to a level which changes its difficulty will _invalidate all previous versions_ for future records on the list. Previous versions for levels that receive minor updates, such as those that fix bugs in the gameplay, will still be acceptable for list records.

## Patched Skips{id=patched-skips}

Many updates remove skips that had been accepted for records on the original version. Existing records will **never be affected after a level update fixes one or more skips**.

The only other change that may take place is for a fixed Type II skip, in which future records that use it will no longer be accepted.

## New or Updated LDMs{id=updated-ldms}

A level may be updated to include a strong LDM or "Ultra" LDM that would not normally be accepted.

Records that were [rejected for a strong LDM](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/#custom-ldms) before such an update _will be re-considered for addition to the list_ in accordance to the new LDM on the rated level.
