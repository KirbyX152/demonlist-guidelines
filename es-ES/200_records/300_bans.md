# Player Bans{id=bans}

**_Any player that posts an illegitimate (hacked) record while passing it off as legitimate will be banned from the stats viewer._**

Each ban _will be indefinite_ until the player confesses to the list team and publicly identifies their illegitimate videos as hacked. In addition, a player publicly encouraging the use of any hacking methods _will be treated as if they submitted a record that used them_. The length of the ban after confession is dependent on the severity of the infraction, the quantity of hacked records, and any attempts to prolong the investigation.

_Any player that continues to hack after or while being banned will be subject to significantly increased or permanent ban times._

## Alternate and 'Qwer' Accounts{id=alternate-accounts}

Alternate accounts are prohibited for players that have already submitted records under a different name. If a player is caught with more than one account on the list, the alternate account(s) will be removed, and the original account will be banned indefinitely until the owner publicly confesses.

In addition, the list team prohibits 'qwer' accounts where multiple players submit records under a single name. These accounts will be banned permanently, and the players involved will be banned indefinitely until each one publicly confesses.
