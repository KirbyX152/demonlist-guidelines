## Handcams{id=handcams}

A handcam is defined as a clear, continuous view of the playerâ€™s input device (e.g. keyboard).

In order to verify that a record was achieved by a single player, **levels using the 2-player gamemode require a handcam to be present throughout raw footage!** Handcams are not required for 1-player levels but are recommended.

## Liveplays{id=liveplays}

Liveplays are recordings in which an external camera records the player's screen.

Bad viewing angles could result in low visibility, which may lead to a rejected record. If you have any concerns regarding the visibility of a liveplay setup, please reach out to a team member for assistance!
