# Raw Footage{id=raw-footage}

Raw footage is defined as the **original file taken from the playerâ€™s recording software** without any modifications. This includes but is not limited to trimming the video, editing in music, or compressing the file in any way.

Players are **required** to provide valid raw footage for every record.

## Censorship{id=censorship}

If you plan to submit edited raw footage for the purpose of censoring personal information, please **describe the situation in as much detail as necessary** so we can take it into account!

Please note that, in most cases, we would still need unedited raw footage in order to accept a record. Note that **any personal information is kept confidential** and does not influence our evaluation of records in any way!
