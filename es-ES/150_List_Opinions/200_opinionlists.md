# Opinion List Analysis{id=analysis}

When considering potential level placements and movements, players are contacted by the list team for their placement opinion and reliability. An opinion sheet is then used to aggregate the opinions of all reliable players.

When starting direct comparisons, the level currently placed at the mean (excluding outliers) or median placement opinion is usually compared to first. If two levels have a low number of mutual victors, the nearest level with a higher number of mutual victors may be chosen for comparison instead. If a level wins a comparison, it will be compared to levels higher on the list, and vice versa. This continues until a placement near the mean/median is found where the level wins below and loses above in direct comparisons.

Once an opinion sheet is complete, the placement or movement must be approved by multiple members of the list team before any change is made to the demon list.
