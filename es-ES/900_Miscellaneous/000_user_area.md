# User Area{id=userarea}

Pointercrate features a [User Area](/login) in which players may create a profile associated with their player on the Demon List. Features such as setting a player location, checking record status, and locking submissions from other players can be accessed here!
  
Any questions regarding claiming a player using your Pointercrate account or using the User Area should be directed to the staff at [Pointercrate Central](https://discord.gg/sQewUEB). Please read the pinned messages in this server before submitting a player claim!
