# Usernames and Nationalities{id=location}

Players who wish to change their name or nationality on the Stats Viewer should send a request in the #player-requests channel of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/demonlist) or contact a list moderator. Some countries also include political subdivisions which players may request as well. Note that players should be a **resident or citizen** of the country they represent.

The [User Area](/login) also includes a player location feature, in which players may geolocate their location to be associated with their name on the Stats Viewer. Any abuse of this system (e.g. blatantly fabricating your location) will result in *permanent exclusion from this feature*.
