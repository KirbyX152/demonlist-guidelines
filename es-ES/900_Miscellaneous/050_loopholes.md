# Loopholes and Exceptions{id=loopholes-and-exceptions}

## Loopholes{id=loopholes}

Although these guidelines aim to cover all things Demon List related, they are not necessarily exhaustive and may be changed in the future. Any player that attempts to evade these guidelines via a loophole in the wording of any rule will be subject to the same punishment _as if that rule was broken_.

## Guideline Exceptions{id=exceptions}

Whenever a new guideline is released, we understand that players may be unaware of recent changes. On a case-by-case basis, the list team may decide to grant a _one-time exception_ for these scenarios and inform the player of what should be done in the future. **Asking the team for an exception does not increase your likelihood of receiving one!**
