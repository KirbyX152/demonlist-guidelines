# Eligibility of Hacks{id=hacks}

Although the list team allows certain hacks for records on the list, players may not submit records obtained using hacks designed to affect the gameplay in any way. Please refer to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evE4nXATxRAQWu2Ajs54E6cVUqHBoSid8I7JauJnOzg/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of allowed hacks for records on the Demon List.

Enabling or disabling allowed hacks to change the difficulty of the level is considered a loophole and will be rejected!

## Mega Hack v7+{id=mhv7}

In addition to using only [allowed hacks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evE4nXATxRAQWu2Ajs54E6cVUqHBoSid8I7JauJnOzg/edit?usp=sharing), users of Mega Hack v7 and above must follow additional requirements:
- Cheat indicator on endscreen must remain enabled
- The FPS counter built into Mega Hack must be enabled
