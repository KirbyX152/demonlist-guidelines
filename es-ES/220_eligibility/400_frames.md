# Framerate Guidelines{id=fps}

For Geometry Dash update 2.2 and beyond, players are permitted to use any framerate.

For any version released before 2.2, **players must use an FPS counter** and **their framerate must remain at or below 360FPS**, regardless of monitor refresh rate. Additionally, **players are not permitted to change FPS values midway through a record**. Although we will reject pre-2.2 records that do not have an FPS counter, a player will not be banned unless they attempt to lie about their framerate.
