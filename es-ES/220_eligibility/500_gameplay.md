# Gameplay Changes{id=gameplay}

In general, records are not eligible for the list if gameplay is changed in any way from the original level.

## Endscreens{id=endscreens}

Records that do not show the **in-game endscreen** after completing a level will not be eligible for the list. The endscreen text should also be _easily readable_ by the viewer. Game crashes during the endscreen animation and other extenuating circumstances may serve as an exception to this rule.

## Game Version{id=game-version}

_Any record_ that was not achieved on the current version of the game **or** the version in which the level was verified will not be accepted to the list.

Note that this guideline permits records achieved on private servers (e.g., the 1.9 GDPS) as long as the list demon was originally verified and published on the server as well.
