# Skips{id=skips}

Skips are divided into _three distinct classifications_, ranging from insignificant orb skips to bypassing entire sections of the level. The eligibility of any skip will be decided by the list team. **Players are highly encouraged to check with the List Team before using a skip!**

## Type I - Always Allowed{id=type1}

A **Type I skip** either barely affects difficulty or makes the level harder than intended while keeping the player on the normal path. A Type I skip _will always be accepted_, even after it is patched in the level on the servers.

## Type II - Allowed if Not Patched{id=type2}

A **Type II skip** is longer or more significant than a Type I skip, but still does not significantly affect difficulty. Type II skips will be accepted _unless they are patched in the level on the servers_. Note that records previously accepted with a Type II skip will remain on the list _unless its classification changes_ (see below).

## Type III - Never Allowed{id=type3}

A **Type III skip** is significant enough to warrant rejecting a completion that uses it. This includes but is not limited to taking a "secret way" or bypassing the hardest part(s) of the level. Players may submit a progress record up to the percent they used a Type III skip.

## Changing Skip Classifications{id=skipchanges}

Although this is uncommon, the List Team may reevaluate the classification of a skip. Records may only be removed if the corresponding skip is now considered a Type III skip. Similarly, records using a skip may be subsequently added if it ends up being less severe compared to our initial evaluation.
