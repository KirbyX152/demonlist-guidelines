# Using Exploits{id=exploits}

In-game bugs and exploits which make levels significantly easier are generally not allowed for list records.

## Pause Buffering{id=pausebuffering}

Using pause buffering to precisely time inputs or to bypass spam-based gameplay is not allowed. Note that this **does not** ban pausing the game or pause-based strategies possible before 2.2.

## Smooth Fix{id=smooth-fix}

A completion which is significantly slowed by the in-game Smooth Fix option is considered equivalent to a speedhacked completion and would not be eligible for the list. However, as long as the player does not hide their use of Smooth Fix, a rejected record *will not result in the player getting banned*.
