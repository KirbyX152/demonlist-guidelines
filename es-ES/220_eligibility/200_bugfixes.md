# Fixing Bugs{id=bugfixes}

Bug fixes may be acceptable for gameplay that is made _impossible or unreasonably more difficult_ by physics changes or certain framerates. **_Players should always verify custom bug fixes with the list team before using them!_**

## Illegal Bug Fixes{id=illegal-bugfixes}

Be aware of the differences between bugs and general inconsistencies! Using illegal bug fixes will cause your record to be rejected.

Submitting an illegal bug fix alone is not grounds for a player ban; however, repeatedly submitting prohibited bug fixes prior to clearing them with the team _may result in a player ban_.

## Custom Speed Changes{id=custom-speed-changes}

Players are allowed to add speed changes at transitions to adjust the sync of the level **if and only if all difficulty remains unchanged**. Any player that manually adds speed changes to a level _should clear it with the List Team before submitting a record_.
