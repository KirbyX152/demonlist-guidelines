# Player Checklist{id=checklist}

This checklist summarizes the most essential steps players should take to minimize delays in getting their records approved! More information can be found in the linked sections of the guidelines.

- Complete the level on the rated version on the servers or on an "official" copy uploaded to the Pointercrate account.<br><br>
- If you complete a level on a copy, clear it with the list team first! This includes but is not limited to [LDMs](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/) and [bug fixes](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes).<br><br>
- [Raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage/) is **required for every submission!** Be sure to provide a [shared Google Drive link](/guidelines/rawfootage#requiredraw) to avoid delays in accepting your record.<br><br>
- Your raw footage must include an audio track with [**isolated click sounds**](/guidelines/miscellaneous#clicks) (i.e., microphone audio and nothing else). Barely audible clicks are considered equivalent to no clicks and will result in a rejected record.<br><br>
- Do not skip the dropdown endscreen after a completion! This will warrant an immediate rejection of your record.<br><br>
- Users of Mega Hack, Geode, other mods are subject to [additional requirements](/guidelines/eligibility#hacks).<br><br>
- For game versions before 2.2, players can use up to 360 FPS and must enable a readable [FPS counter](/guidelines/eligibility#fps)!<br><br>
- If you record a [liveplay](/guidelines/rawfootage#handcams-and-liveplays) (e.g., with your phone camera), make sure that your screen is clearly visible!
