# Level Eligibility{id=placementeligibility}

A level must be **rated in-game** and must be considered *harder than the current demon placed at #150* in order to be placed on the Demon List.

All levels must be legitimately verified by a single player, including solo verifications of 2-player levels. Levels will only be placed if proof of verification is provided to the list team, and this proof must meet our current standards for record eligibility.

Rated levels without verification proof can also be placed once completed by another player, regardless of verification rights.
