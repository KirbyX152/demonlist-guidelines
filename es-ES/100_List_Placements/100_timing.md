# Timing of Placements{id=timing-of-placements}

We will place a list-worthy level **one month** after it gets rated in-game. If a level is unquestionably the new #1 demon, it may be placed on the list sooner or instantly. Levels using the 2-player gamemode may be subject to an extended deadline.

Please note that this guideline does **not** apply to levels with a hacked verification; the one-month timeline for a hacked level begins after it receives its first legitimate victor. In addition, this one-month timeline will **reset** if the level receives an [update](/guidelines/levelupdates/) with a legitimate verification.
