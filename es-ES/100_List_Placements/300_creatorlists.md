# Creator Lists{id=creators}

In general, the list team only adds creators that created "standalone" parts for a level; their contributions must not merely append to the work of another creator. This applies to _both gameplay and decoration_.

Other individuals that played a major role in the levelâ€™s development may also be credited on the creator list, which includes level hosts and optimization teams, but **does not** include playtesters. Other cases in which the contribution may or may not be significant enough to qualify will be handled by the list team on a case-by-case basis.

Some levels may contain offscreen parts that have unique creators but are not featured in the level's completion route. These creators **will not** be credited on the level page.

## Host Privileges{id=host-privileges}

If the original verifier of a list demon is removed from the stats viewer, the host of the level has the right to change the listed verifier to another player with a legitimate completion. In the case of a hacked verification, the first legitimate victor of the level may also choose to be listed as the verifier.
